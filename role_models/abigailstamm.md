## What do you do?

I am maintain a database and analyze hospitalization data for the State Department of Health. I use R to check for data entry issues, clean data, and develop charts for factsheets. I use RMarkdown to produce regular summary reports. I use a combination of SAS and R to subset and analyze data.

## How did you get interested in STEM?

My father teaches atmospheric science and my mother is a geneticist. My parents raised me to question everything and experiment when I wanted to know if or how something worked. I was originally interested in astronomy and zoology (I wanted to be a biologist aboard Star Trek's USS Enterprise). After college, I joined the Peace Corps in southern Africa, where my passion shifted to human health.

## What is the thing you enjoy the most of your job?

I like the peope the most. My coworkers are hard workers, dedicated, curious, and eager to help if I need it. Through work, I have joined Toastmasters and co-facilitate regular R workshops. For the work itself, I like that I can choose within reason which software I want to use to write a report, develop a factsheet, or analyze a dataset.

## What did you struggle the most during your undergraduate studies?

Figuring out my major. I wanted to do everything and took courses all over the university. I had friends in every department, which came in handy when I struggled with coursework. I finally settled on Anthropology more because it allowed me to study abroad than because it was the best fit for me. With all the theory and reading, it was not a good fit, which is why I shifted my focus back to the sciences.

## Do you have any role models?

One of my childhood role models was George Washington Carver, who became a plant doctor without a proper education and found people to support him even when schools and jobs turned him away. He eventually became a university professor who built his own botany lab from scratch, invented hundreds of uses for foods to increase their marketability, and taught poor farmers how to increase their crop yields. I wanted to do all those things, but with animals instead of plants.

## What advice or tips would you like to give to people interested in a career in STEM?

Meet people in the field and ask questions. Stay in touch with former professors and mentors. Always be willing to learn new skills.

Having friends who do STEM work, and being willing to ask for and offer help, has helped me to learn the skills I need to do my work. I am developing my reputation as a facilitator and a mentor so that when opportunities become available, I one of the people asked.
